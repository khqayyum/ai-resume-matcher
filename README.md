## AI Resume Matcher (Serverless on AWS)


## Overview

AI Resume Matcher is an **end-to-end serverless pipeline** that automatically extracts text from resumes (PDFs) and matches it against a given job description.
What makes this project special is that itâ€™s built entirely with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **AWS CloudFormation**.  
All AWS resources â€” S3 buckets, Lambda functions, IAM roles, API Gateway routes, EventBridge rules, and SNS topics â€” are provisioned and managed through YAML stacks. This ensures the system is reproducible, maintainable, and production-ready.

## Architecture

UI["index_final.html CloudFront"] --> API["API Gateway GET /upload-url"]
API --> UP["Lambda: upload-url"]
UP --> S3["S3 uploads/"]
S3 --> EVB["EventBridge"] --> DIS["Lambda: dispatcher"]

TEX --> SNS["SNS Topic"] --> COL["Lambda: collector"]
COL --> EXT["S3 extracted/"]
COL --> MAPS["S3 maps/"]

```

## How it works

1. Frontend (CloudFront + S3): User uploads a resume PDF via the UI.
2. Presigned URL Lambda + API Gateway: Generates a temporary upload link.
3. S3 + EventBridge: New file in uploads/ triggers the dispatcher Lambda.
4. Textract + SNS + Collector Lambda: Extracts text, stores results in extracted/ and maps/.
5. Score Lambda: Compares resume text with job description and returns similarity score + missing keywords.
6. UI: Displays the result back to the user.

## Services Used

- **Amazon S3** â€“ stores resumes, extracted text, and JSON maps
- **Amazon CloudFront** â€“ serves static UI globally
- **Amazon API Gateway** (HTTP API) â€“ routes requests to Lambda
- **AWS Lambda** (Node.js 20) â€“ serverless functions: upload-url, dispatcher, collector, score
- **Amazon Textract** â€“ extracts structured text from resumes
- **Amazon SNS** â€“ event channel for Textract results
- **Amazon EventBridge** â€“ triggers dispatcher Lambda on file uploads
- **AWS IAM Roles & Policies** â€“ secure access control

## How to Use

1. Open the CloudFront UI: https://d2a16brw1up50y.cloudfront.net
2. Upload a resume PDF (max ~10 MB).
3. Paste a job description into the text box.
4. Submit â†’ wait a few seconds while Textract processes the resume.
5. View your similarity score and missing keywords in the results.
